# Chatting with an AI model is like...

Well, it's like talking with a patient in the psych ward who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and doesn't take their medication.

Then I realized what AI really is.  An LLM, Large Language Model, like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot is not designed to correctly answer your questions.  It is designed to repetitively perform simple tasks and to provide the user with information.  AI was never designed to be right!

Realizing what that meant was a turning point for me. ChatGPT and others are designed around providing simple pieces of information that the user can then use it for whatever purpose they desire. The trick is to prompt the LLM for as specific set as instructions as possible to get something that suits their purpose and can also be used as part of a chain of prompts to produce a much larger piece of information, or tool.

The trick is to know how to ask the LLM your questions in such a way that it will produce exactly what you want, whether that is an article produced for a peer reviewed journal, with references and specific formatting, or a simple fictional story you can read to your child.

Creating these questions, or prompts is this much like building a bridge.  You carefully design, build, and put together everything piece by piece. This we have the practice of Engineering Prompt Engineering.
